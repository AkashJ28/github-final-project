# üßÆ Simple Interest Calculator

A command-line utility to quickly calculate simple interest.

This tool computes the interest on a principal amount based on a given annual rate and time period. It's designed for simplicity and ease of use.

---

## Formula

The calculation is based on the standard simple interest formula:

$$\text{Simple Interest} = P \times R \times T$$

Where:
- **P** is the Principal Amount
- **R** is the Annual Rate of Interest (as a decimal)
- **T** is the Time Period in Years

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Input Parameters

The program requires three numerical inputs:

| Parameter | Symbol | Description                                        | Example Value |
| :-------- | :----: | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Principal** | `p`    | The initial amount of money.                       | `1500`        |
| **Time** | `t`    | The duration for which the money is borrowed/invested, in years. | `2`           |
| **Rate** | `r`    | The annual interest rate, **expressed as a decimal**. | `0.05` (for 5%) |

### Output

The program returns a single numerical value:

-   **Simple Interest**: The total interest amount calculated from the inputs.

## üöÄ Example Usage

Let's say you want to calculate the simple interest on a principal of **$1,500** for **2 years** at an annual rate of **5%**.

#### Inputs:
-   `p` = `1500`
-   `t` = `2`
-   `r` = `0.05`

#### Calculation:
#### Expected Output:
150.0
